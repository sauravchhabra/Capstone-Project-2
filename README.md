# Capstone-Project
7th and 8th Project for Advanced Android Nanodegree at Udacity.

This app fetches the data from Zomato API and shows the user all the nearby restaurant. This app conforms to Material Design Guideline.
Also I have provided a widget to add on the homescreen where user can see all their favorite restaurants.
